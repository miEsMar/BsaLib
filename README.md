# BSA

BSA library provides a framework for the Bispectral Stochastic Analysis of linear systems, 
under non-Gaussian stationary random excitations. 

It is conceived to be a **plug-in** library for any personal/commercial Finite Element software capable 
of providing some basic features.

Its main API is defined in the main library interface module file `.\src\BsaLib\BsaLib.f90`.
